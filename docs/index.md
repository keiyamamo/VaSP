# The Vascular Fluid Structure Interaction Pipeline

The Vascular Fluid Structure Interaction Pipeline ([VaSP](https://github.com/KVSlab/VaSP)) is a Python package that provides a pipeline for performing vascular fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations. The pipeline is built on top of the [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org) finite element library, [turtleFSI](https://github.com/KVSlab/turtleFSI), and [VMTK](http://www.vmtk.org). VaSP streamlines the process of performing FSI simulations in vascular systems, starting from medical image-based surface meshes and ending with the computation of hemodynamic indices like wall shear stress and stress/strain.

In this documentation, we provide a detailed guide on how to use VaSP for performing vascular FSI simulations. The documentation is divided into the following sections:
