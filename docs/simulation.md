# Running Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) Simulations

## Simulations using `turtleFSI`

`VaSP` uses [turtleFSI](https://github.com/KVSlab/turtleFSI) for performing FSI simulations. In short, `turtleFSI` is a monolithic FSI solver built based on [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org). For the detailed usage of `turtleFSI` and tutorials, users are referred to the [turtleFSI documentation](https://turtlefsi2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Here, we will introduce the very basic command for using `turtleFSI` and supporting functions that are specifically added for performing vascular FSI. 

To run FSI simulations with `turtleFSI`, users typically need to create a problem file that contains information about input parameters and boundary conditions. How to create your own problem file is explained in details [here](https://turtlefsi2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_turtleFSI.html#create-your-own-problem-file). With the problem file and the mesh from pre-processing step in hand, you can now run FSI simulation with `turtleFSI` as follows:

```console
turtleFSI -p name_of_the_problem_file (without .py)
```

It is also possible to run `turtleFSI` with Message Passing Interface (MPI) for possibly speeding up the simulation. To run `turtleFSI` with MPI, please use:

```console
mpirun -np [number_of_cpu] -p name_of_the_problem_file (without .py)
```

`turtleFSI` also supports using config file for changing the parameter without modifying the original problem file. To run a problem file with config file, please use:

```console
turtleFSI -p name_of_the_problem_file (without .py) -c path_to_config_file
```

An example of config file is located [here](https://github.com/KVSlab/turtleFSI/tree/master/docs/examples).

For example, if the user want to run a problem file named `my_problem.py` with config file `my_config.config` using 4 processors, the command should be:

```console
mpirun -np 4 turtleFSI -p my_problem -c my_config.config
```

In this case, it is assumed that `my_problem.py` and `my_config.config` are located in the same folder as the current working directory.

## Monitoring tool during the simulation
(simulation:log_plotter)=

Due to the nature of vascular FSI simulations, it is usually the case that the simulation needs to be run on the supercomputer with many CPUs where the total simulation time may exceed one day. In such a case, it is crucial to monitor the progress of your simulations and check if the simulations are going as you wish. For that purpose, `vasp-log-plotter` can be used to plot the relevant quantities based on the log file generated during the run. 

Since the plot is generated based on the log file, users must use functions from `vasp.simulations.simulation_common` to print out the information in the log file. Particularly, functions such as `load_probe_points`, 
`print_probe_points`, `calculate_and_print_flow_properties` are important. Example problem files located under `src/vasp/simulations` illustrates how to use those functions inside the problem files.

Quantities that can be plotted are as follows:

<ul>
  <li> cpu time per time-step against simulation time </li>
  <li> number of newton iterations to converge to the specified tolerance (absolute & relative)</li>
  <li> velocity and pressure magnitude at probe points in fluid domain over time</li>
  <li> displacement magnitude at probe points in solid domain over time</li>
  <li> flow rate at the inlet</li>
  <li> maximum, minimum, and average velocity in the entire domain </li>
  <li> maximum, minimum, and average CFL number in the entire domain </li>
  <li> maximum, minimum, and average Reynolds number in the entire domain </li>
</ul>

To get a complete list of the parameters, please run:

```console
vasp-log-plotter --help
```

{numref}`log_plotter` is an example of the plot showing CPU time per time-step and CFL number.
